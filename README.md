# PCILeech, MemProcFS and LeechCore

This project contains a [Nix flake](https://nix.dev/concepts/flakes.html) with
[Nixpkgs overlays](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#chap-overlays) that
provide packages for PCILeech, MemProcFS and LeechCore.

## Supported Systems

We run flake checks on `x86_64-linux` for the following systems:
- `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`

The primary development machine is `aarch64-linux` system, however, GitHub
Actions CI does not provide AArch64 runners on Linux and Apple Silicon runners
lack nested virtualization support.

## System Dependencies

MemProcFS VMM bundles SQLite and miniz dependencies with hard-coded `#include`
paths. Currently, we do not patch the code to use packages from Nixpkgs.

## Dynamic Libraries

LeechCore and MemProcFS have non-trivial interactions between installed shared
libraries. There is also cyclic dependency between `libleechcore.so` and
`libvmm.so` (LeechCore dynamically loads MemProcFSâ€™s Virtual Memory Management
library that depends on LeechCore).

    vmm -- "dlopen search path" --> mscompress
    vmm -- "dlopen at $ORIGIN/plugins" --> m_vmemd
    vmm -- "dlopen at $ORIGIN" --> pdbcrust
```

<dl>
  <dt>dlopen at $ORIGIN</dt>
  <dd>dlopen with absolute path below the shared object path</dd>
  <dt>dlopen search path</dt>
  <dd>dlopen with file name argument, i.e. without slash character.</dd>
  <dt>dlopen user-configurable</dt>
  <dd>dlopen with multiple candidates, including search path.</dd>
</dl>

When applicable, we apply patches to also use dlopen search path and append
dependencies to shared library RUNPATH using patchelf.

VMM users that need LeechCore VMM driver (implemented in `device_vmm.c`) should
set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. That is because LeechCore cannot depend on VMM to break
cyclic dependency and we want to avoid bundling these packages together.
